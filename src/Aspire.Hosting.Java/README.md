# Java hosting integration

Use this integration to model, configure, and orchestrate a Java application resource in an Aspire solution.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

A **JDK** must be available on the PATH of the machine running the AppHost. Aspire does not install one.

Applications are launched through the **Maven or Gradle wrapper** (`mvnw`/`gradlew`) checked into the
project, which needs nothing else installed. A wrapper is required: Aspire deliberately does not fall back
to a globally installed `mvn` or `gradle`, because the wrapper pins the tool version in the repository so
the AppHost, CI, and the published container image all build with the same one. Add a wrapper with
`mvn -N wrapper:wrapper` or `gradle wrapper`, or select one elsewhere with `WithWrapperPath(...)`.

For VS Code debugging, install
[Language Support for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.java) and
[Debugger for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-debug).

### Add the integration

From your AppHost directory, add the `Aspire.Hosting.Java` integration with the Aspire CLI:

```bash
aspire add Aspire.Hosting.Java
```

## Usage example

Then, in the AppHost, add a Java application resource and reference it from another resource with either C# or TypeScript:

**C#**

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var catalog = builder.AddJavaApp("catalog", "../catalog")
    .WithMavenGoal("spring-boot:run")
    // Spring Boot reads SERVER_PORT, so the port Aspire assigns reaches the app with no code change.
    .WithHttpEndpoint(env: "SERVER_PORT")
    .WithExternalHttpEndpoints();

builder.AddProject<Projects.Frontend>("frontend")
    .WithReference(catalog)
    .WaitFor(catalog);

builder.Build().Run();
```

**TypeScript**

```typescript
import { createBuilder } from "./.aspire/modules/aspire.mjs";

const builder = await createBuilder();

const catalog = await builder.addJavaApp("catalog", "../catalog");
await catalog.withMavenGoal("spring-boot:run", []);
await catalog.withHttpEndpoint({ env: "SERVER_PORT" });
await catalog.withExternalHttpEndpoints();

const orders = await builder.addJavaApp("orders", "../orders");
await orders.withGradleTask("bootRun", []);
await orders.withHttpEndpoint({ env: "SERVER_PORT" });
await orders.withReference(catalog);
await orders.waitFor(catalog);

await builder.build().run();
```

`appDirectory` is the process working directory and the publish build context, so everything the build
needs must live inside it.

### Launch modes

A resource runs in exactly one of three ways, and configuring a second one throws:

| Mode | How to select it | What runs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Prebuilt JAR | `AddJavaApp(name, appDirectory, jarPath)` | `java -jar <jarPath>` |
| Maven goal | `WithMavenGoal("spring-boot:run")` | `mvnw spring-boot:run` |
| Gradle task | `WithGradleTask("bootRun")` | `gradlew bootRun` |

Arguments passed to `AddJavaApp` or `WithArgs(...)` belong to the application. Arguments for the build
tool are passed to `WithMavenGoal`/`WithGradleTask`, which keeps the two sets separable — the IDE needs
to drop the wrapper's arguments when it launches the JVM directly to debug it.

### Running an image someone else built

When the application ships as a container image — built by a separate pipeline, or by a team that hands
you an image rather than source — use `AddJavaContainerApp` instead. Aspire runs the image as-is and
never rebuilds it, so the JAR, the JDK, and any OpenTelemetry agent all come from the image:

```csharp
builder.AddJavaContainerApp("catalog", "mycompany/catalog", "1.4.0")
    .WithHttpEndpoint(targetPort: 8080)
    .WithReference(db)
    .WithJvmArgs("-Xmx512m");
```

No endpoint is declared for you, because the port is a property of the image; 8080 is the default for
Spring Boot and Quarkus. `WithOtelAgent` does not apply here — it copies an agent out of the build
context, and there is no build. If the image already carries the agent, turn it on with
`WithJvmArgs("-javaagent:/app/opentelemetry-javaagent.jar")`.

### Building before running

```csharp
builder.AddJavaApp("worker", "../worker", "target/worker.jar")
    .WithMavenBuild("-B", "-ntp", "-DskipTests", "package");
```

`WithMavenBuild`/`WithGradleBuild` add a child resource that runs before the application starts, and the
application waits for it to succeed. The same arguments also drive the container build during
`aspire publish`, so they should produce the deployable artifact — `build -x test` rather than `classes`
for Gradle, for example.

### Options

| Method | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `WithMavenGoal(string goal, params string[] args)` | Launches through `mvnw` with the given goal |
| `WithGradleTask(string task, params string[] args)` | Launches through `gradlew` with the given task |
| `WithMavenBuild(params string[] args)` | Builds with Maven before the app runs, and in the published container |
| `WithGradleBuild(params string[] args)` | Builds with Gradle before the app runs, and in the published container |
| `WithWrapperPath(string wrapperScript)` | Selects a wrapper outside the app directory. May be called before or after the build tool is configured |
| `WithMainClass(string mainClass)` | The fully qualified class the IDE launches when debugging |
| `WithJarArtifact(string jarPath)` | Names the JAR the container build should deploy, when the build produces more than one |
| `WithJvmArgs(params string[] args)` | Appends JVM arguments through `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS`. Also available on `AddJavaContainerApp` |
| `WithOtelAgent(string agentPath)` | Runs the app under the OpenTelemetry Java agent |

### Telemetry

`AddJavaApp` configures the OTLP exporter environment on its own, which is all a manually instrumented
application needs. `WithOtelAgent(...)` additionally runs the
[OpenTelemetry Java agent](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation), which
instruments common frameworks with no code change:

```csharp
builder.AddJavaApp("catalog", "../catalog")
    .WithMavenBuild("-B", "-ntp", "-DskipTests", "package")
    .WithMavenGoal("spring-boot:run")
    .WithOtelAgent("target/agent/opentelemetry-javaagent.jar");
```

The agent is not downloaded for you. Fetch it as a build dependency so it exists before the application
starts — a relative path is resolved against the app directory when running locally, and the published
container copies the build's agent into the image. Because the agent is applied through
`JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS`, which every JVM beneath the resource inherits, the build tool's own JVM is
instrumented as well.

### Debugging

Debugging is enabled automatically by `AddJavaApp` — use the normal Aspire "Start Debugging" flow in
VS Code. The IDE launches the JVM directly rather than through the wrapper, because `spring-boot:run`
and `bootRun` fork a second JVM that a debugger attached to the wrapper would never see. Set
`WithMainClass(...)` to say which class to launch; for a prebuilt JAR the archive is put on the
debugger's classpath and its manifest's `Main-Class` is launched, which is what `java -jar` does.

### Publishing

`aspire publish` and `aspire deploy` build the app into a container. An app that runs should publish with
no extra configuration: if the app directory contains a `Dockerfile` it is used as-is, otherwise one is
generated that builds the project inside the container. The container runs as a non-root `app` user, and
the JVM is PID 1 so it receives `SIGTERM` directly and shutdown hooks run.

The generated build stage reuses the wrapper and the arguments from `WithMavenBuild`/`WithGradleBuild`,
falling back to `package` or `build` when neither is configured. Dependency caches are kept in a BuildKit
cache mount rather than baked into a layer.

The deployed JAR is whichever one the build produces, ignoring `-plain`, `-sources`, and `-javadoc`
artifacts. When that is still ambiguous the build fails and names the candidates; select one with
`WithJarArtifact(...)`.

#### Base images

The Java release is read from `pom.xml` or the Gradle build file, and defaults to 21.

| Stage | Default |
| --- | --- |
| Build | `docker.io/library/eclipse-temurin:{version}-jdk` |
| Runtime | `docker.io/library/eclipse-temurin:{version}-jre` |

A plain JDK image is enough for the build stage because the build always runs through the project's own
wrapper, and the wrapper downloads the Maven or Gradle version the repository pins.

Override both stages in a single call:

```csharp
builder.AddJavaApp("catalog", "../catalog")
    .WithDockerfileBaseImage(
        buildImage: "example/java-build:latest",
        runtimeImage: "example/java-runtime:latest");
```
